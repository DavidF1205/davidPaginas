I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at Universidade Lus√≥fona, with expertise in software development, database management, and systems analysis. I have experience in photography and videography, having produced professional videos such as trailers and backstage footage for musicals and theater productions. Additionally, I manage social media accounts, creating engaging visual content and implementing digital strategies. I also completed a professional course in Laboratory Analysis Technician, where I gained practical experience through an internship. I am passionate about communication, traveling, and exploring new adventures to grow personally and professionally.
